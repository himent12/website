## 📖 Documents Overview

### [Architecture Refactoring Plan](architecture/refactoring-plan.md)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive architectural document for transforming the monolithic Express.js server into a modular, maintainable system.

**Contents**:
- Current state analysis of the 1,399-line monolithic server
- Detailed modular architecture design
- File structure and module specifications
- Dependency management and data flow
- Configuration management strategy
- Error handling and testing strategies
- Performance benefits and success metrics

**Audience**: Technical leads, architects, and senior developers

### [Migration Implementation Guide](architecture/migration-guide.md)
**Purpose**: Step-by-step practical guide for implementing the refactoring plan.

**Contents**:
- 5-phase migration plan with weekly milestones
- Detailed implementation steps with code examples
- Testing strategies and rollback procedures
- Troubleshooting guide and success metrics
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

**Audience**: Developers implementing the refactoring

## 🎯 Key Architectural Decisions

### Dual Deployment Support
The refactored architecture supports both:
- **Express.js** for local development and traditional server deployment
- **Vercel Serverless Functions** for production deployment
- **Shared Business Logic** between both environments

### Modular Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one specific concern
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies rather than creating them
- **Environment Agnostic**: Code works across different deployment contexts
- **Testability**: All modules can be unit tested in isolation

### Service-Oriented Architecture
```

└─────────┬───────┘    └─────────┬───────┘
          │                      │
